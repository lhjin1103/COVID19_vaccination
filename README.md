# COVID19_vaccination
KAIST CS492(B) Introduction to R final project

## Motivation

Today, COVID-19 vaccination is a very popular topic since most of the countries are doing their best on it.
Some of the countries are about to form the social immunity (herd immunity), but Korea is in the beginning.
Since there are various datasets related to COVID-19 vaccination, we chose this topic for our project.  
We thought that by analyzing the real data, we have to get an insight about the current worldwide vaccination
progress and the details of COVID-19 vaccination.  

## Datasets

### Our World In Data COVID-19 dataset
https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus

### VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Effect Report System) dataset 
https://vaers.hhs.gov/data.html


## R&R
 Kyungmin made data overview plots, tried linear modeling with different observations and countries. Also
searched for VAERS dataset and did preprocessing.  
 Hyejin did OWID-COVID data preprocessing, made III-2 boxplot, made three models and analyzed VAERS
dataset.
